<br>
The television series Sesame Street is concerned mainly with teaching
preschool skills to children age 3-5, with special emphasis on
reaching economically disadvantaged children.  &nbsp;The show is
designed to hold young childrens' attention through action oriented,
short duration presentations teaching specific preschool cognitive
skills and some social skills.  Each show is one hour and involves much
repetition of concepts within and across shows. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Does Sesame Street help economically disadvantaged children 'catch-up'
with economically advantaged children? &nbsp;In the early 1970s,
researchers at Educational Testing Service (the company that runs the
SAT) ran a study to evaluate Sesame Street. &nbsp; The researchers
sampled children representative of economically advantaged and
disadvantaged populations from five different sites in the United
States.  &nbsp;To ensure the study contained a group of children that
watched Sesame Street regularly, they randomly assigned children either
to receive encouragement to watch Sesame Street or not to receive
encouragement. &nbsp;Those assigned to encouragement were given
promotional materials, and received weekly visits and phone calls from
ETS staff. &nbsp;Those assigned not to receive encouragement did not
get this attention. The children were tested on a variety of cognitive variables, including
knowledge of body parts, knowledge about letters, knowledge about
numbers, etc., both before and after viewing the series.<br>
<br>
These data, available on Sakai in the Class Datasets folder, are part of a larger data set
used to evaluate the impact of Sesame Street. The names of
variables are shown in the code book below.    Questions for the data analysis are as follows.<br>
<br>

1.  Does encouragement to watch Sesame Street appear to improve students' scores on the test about numbers?  If so, by roughly how much? <br><br>

2.  Does any effect of encouragement appear to differ by demographic group (site)?  Describe any differences in the effect of encouragement. <br><br>
